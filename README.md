### About Me

A tech-savvy sports enthusiast turned coding aficionado, I've sprinted through sales and dove headfirst into the world of video game design. Now, armed with a keyboard and a dream, I'm on a mission to conquer the digital universe, one line of code at a time. Join me on this epic quest, where bugs are foes to be vanquished and algorithms are my trusty allies!

### What I'm Working On
